  /**This code defines an Observer class that is part of the Observer design pattern  . The purpose of this class is to define a method that will implemented by concrete observer classes 
   * 
   * 
   * To connect the observer pattern to our existing smsnotificiona and emailnotifications observer , we can treat these notifications classes as conrete observers that will be notified of changes and perform actions accordingly. You have a Weather Station (Subject) and SMSNotification and EmailNotification (Observers).
When a user recieves a notification, you want the observer to notify the SMSNotification and EmailNotification systems. These systems will then send notifications to users via SMS or Email.
